#### {User can find out what type of triangle it is depending on the lengths given}, {2019}
#### By **{Yasmin Abdirahman}**  
## Description
{This is a application created where the user can give the three lengths of a triangle and it results in the type of triangle it is. Whether an equilateral, isosceles , scalene or no triangle at all.}
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Clone this repo to your desktop ,run it on the terminal using the command (git clone URL.git)
* For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal. (for example 3,3 & 3)
For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.(4,4 & 7)
For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.(12,8,4)
If the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values. (For example, the values 9,4 & 3 cannot form a triangle.)
